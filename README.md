## Contribution

Contributions are welcome. Please follow:

1. Fork this repository
2. Add nodes or links in related json files. Add "contributor" key optionally.
3. Testing
4. Make Pull request

If there are too many nodes/links in a single file, you may extract them into a new JSON in a directory,
and add the JSON file into `/database.json`.

### Testing

When testing locally, you need to start a http server
(because most browser does not accept reading json files in `file://`).
For example, using python 3's built-in http server:

~~~bash
python3 -m http.server
~~~

Then you can use `http://localhost:8000` to view the local site.
For testing single(or several) JSON, you may use `?d=` in query string, such as `http://localhost:8000/?d=/tech/graphics/shadow/shadow.json&e=-1`.
